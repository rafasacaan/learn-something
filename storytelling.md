# Storytelling
Taken from IESE Business school coursera

Tell stories with a purpose.

### Main use of a story? 
Talk about principles and values of a social group.
Think about the purpose of our story


### When?
- To start a discourse
- To recover audience attention
- Persuade about principles and values
- To speak about strength and weaknesses


### Structure of a good story
- When and where
    - specific time (specific date, or relative date) and place
- Context
    - Ordinary life, how was it
- Surprise
    - Disrupt!
- Tension! The surprise generates tensions
    - Describe risks involved
    - How do we feel towards the threat
- Action
    - Who did what
    - How they did it
- Results
    - Did they fail? did the protagonist achieved success? 
    - Success stories inspire emulation, follow that
    - Failure stories convince people to avoid specific dangers
    - The result is a fruit of the action, not something that happened by chance
- Takeaway
    - We do not want to entertain, but to convey a message effectively and in an interesting way
    - This is the best way to deliver a message
    - Its better if its a single message that we deliver
    - More than pushing, its about pulling
    - Emphasize how we feel inside, fears, challenges, risks


Important: timing and proportions
- The order is relevant time-wise
- For instance, the surprise must be proportional to the tension
- Which must be proportional to the action, and so on


### Mistakes!
- Insufficient presentation: make them live the emotional process, describe
- Weak conflict or no conflict - conflict are the energy of the story, they make it compelling
- Absence of sensations
- Telling it from the outside
- More than one plot
- Things happen without suffering, things happen by luck
- More than one takeaway


### What does work!
- Write and rewrite and rewrite
- Practice!
- Rule of 3 in using preparation
    - 1/3 to correct it
    - 1/3 to practice and read/watch it
    - 1/3 to write the story
- Direct dialogue is better than indirect: embody the story through characters
- Control pauses and meaningful silences
